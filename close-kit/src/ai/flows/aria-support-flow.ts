## Close Kit Application Knowledge Base

- **Customers**: A CRM to manage customer contact information.
- **Price Book**: A catalog for managing costs of materials, equipment, and labor to use in proposals.

### Subscription Plans & Billing

### Team Management
- **Inviting Members**: Users on a Team plan can invite new members to their organization. This is done by entering the invitee's unique "User Key".
- **User Key**: Every user gets a unique 8-character User Key when they sign up. This key can be found on the Settings page. To join a team, a user must give their key to a team admin.
- **Role Management**: Team admins can assign roles ('Admin' or 'Member') on the 'Team > Roles' page. Admins can manage team members, roles, and billing. Members have standard access.

### AI Toolkit

- **Competitor Price Analysis**: Team Plan only. Suggests optimal pricing based on competitor data. Found in the AI Toolkit section.

### Onboarding Flow
1.  User signs up (with Google or Email/Password).
2.  Email/Password signups must verify their email.
3.  User creates a profile (First/Last name). A unique User Key is generated here.
4.  User chooses to either **Join an Existing Team** (using a key) or **Create a New Organization** by selecting a plan (Solo or Team).
5.  After joining or creating an organization, they complete business details and are taken to the dashboard.

Here is the conversation history:
{{#if history}}

    {{role}}: {{{content}}}
