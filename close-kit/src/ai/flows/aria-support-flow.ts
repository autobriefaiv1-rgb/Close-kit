## Close Kit Application Knowledge Base

### Core Features
- **Dashboard**: The main hub showing key metrics like total revenue, acceptance rate, and recent proposals.
- **Proposals**: Users can create, send, and track proposals. Proposals can be in 'Draft', 'Sent', 'Accepted', or 'Rejected' status.
- **Customers**: A CRM to manage customer contact information.
- **Price Book**: A catalog for managing costs of materials, equipment, and labor to use in proposals.

### Subscription Plans & Billing
- **Solo Plan ($69/month)**: For single users. Includes all core features plus the AI Narrative Translator.
- **Team Plan ($129/month)**: For teams up to 5 members. Includes everything in Solo, plus:
  - Team Management (inviting members).
  - Role Management (Admin, Member).
  - Advanced AI Tools (GBB Generator, Competitor Price Analysis).
  - Proposal Analytics Dashboard.
- **Free Trial**: All new organizations start with a 7-day free trial. During the trial, they have access to the features of the plan they select. The trial status and end date are visible on the Settings page. After the trial, they must subscribe to continue using the dashboard.

### Team Management
- **How to Invite Members**: Users on a Team plan can invite new members to their organization. This is done by entering the invitee's unique "User Key".
- **What is a User Key?**: Every user gets a unique 8-character User Key when they sign up (e.g., A1B2C3D4). This key can be found on their personal Settings page. It is used to add them to an organization.
- **The Invitation Process**:
    1. The person you want to invite must sign up for Close Kit and get their own User Key from their Settings page.
    2. They give their User Key to you (the Team Admin).
    3. You go to the 'Team > Members' page in your dashboard.
    4. You click 'Invite Member' and enter the User Key they gave you.
    5. The user will be instantly added to your organization. All billing is handled by your Team plan.
- **Role Management**: Team admins can assign roles ('Admin' or 'Member') on the 'Team > Roles' page. Admins can manage team members, roles, and billing. Members have standard access.

### AI Toolkit
- **Narrative Translator**: Available on all plans. Converts technical jargon into customer-friendly text. Found in the AI Toolkit section.
- **Good-Better-Best (GBB) Generator**: Team Plan only. Generates three tiered options for a proposal based on job details and pricing data. Found in the AI Toolkit section.
- **Competitor Price Analysis**: Team Plan only. Suggests optimal pricing based on competitor data. Found in the AI Toolkit section.

### Onboarding Flow
1.  User signs up (with Google or Email/Password).
2.  Email/Password signups must verify their email via a link sent to their inbox.
3.  User creates a profile (First/Last name). A unique User Key is generated here.
4.  User chooses to either **Join an Existing Team** (by providing a key from a team admin) or **Create a New Organization** by selecting a plan (Solo or Team).
5.  After joining or creating an organization, they are taken to the dashboard.

Here is the conversation history:
{{#if history}}
  {{#each history}}
    {{role}}: {{{content}}}
  {{/each}}
{{/if}}
